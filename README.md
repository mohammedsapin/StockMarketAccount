# StockMarketAccount
For this project we were asked to write a system which models stock market and the bank account using the c++ class features including inheritence. The user has access to a stock account and a bank account that share the same cash balance. The user is able to buy stocks, sell stocks, view their portfolio, and view there stock transaction history. The stocks are already available in the provided .txt files. When calculating prices, the program chooses 1 of the 4 available stock files at random to calculate current prices. When the program runs, the first thing is to show the user three options to work with either stock account, bank account, or exit the program. The sub menu for each will be as following:
